# 🌍 Project Summary: Visualizing Global Wealth 📊

Welcome to my Excel and Tableau project! In this project, I utilized the "Wealth of Nations" dataset to explore and visualise global wealth trends. Here's a breakdown of what I've done:

## 🧹 Data Cleaning and Preparation

I began by cleaning, filtering, and sorting the dataset using Excel to ensure accuracy and consistency in the data. I also explored further and created a few charts. 

## 📊 Visualization with Tableau

Using Tableau, I created a series of visualizations to depict various aspects of global wealth distribution. It's important to note that the client requested special consideration for color blindness when designing the dashboard.

## 🎨 Visuals for Color Blindness

To accommodate the client's needs, all visuals in the dashboard are optimized for color blindness. This ensures that the data is accessible and understandable for all users.


## Visualisation:
The client expressed interest in focusing solely on the top 20 highest ranking countries in terms of wealth, life expectency and smartphone usuage. Therefore, the dashboard includes four visuals, each designed to provide unique insights for these countries.

Feel free to explore the project and its visuals!
